# Simple Examinations System

A web-based examination system designed to deliver a smooth and interactive quiz-taking experience. This project demonstrates core JavaScript functionality, CSS styling, and HTML structure, along with user experience features like randomized questions and answers, a timer bar, and dynamic animations.


## Features

1. **Exam Questions**:
   - A set of 10 exam questions stored in a JavaScript array of objects.
   - Each question object contains:
     - **Title**: The main question text.
     - **Image**: A relevant image for the question.
     - **Answers**: Multiple choice options.
     - **Correct Answer**: The valid answer for grading.

2. **File Organization**:
   - Separate files for **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to maintain code clarity and organization.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Clean and modern design with well-aligned elements for an intuitive user experience.
   - Google Fonts applied to enhance question and answer styling.

4. **Home Page**:
   - Accepts the student name via a **popup modal** (using a popular library like SweetAlert2).
   - Activates the start button after entering the name.

5. **Exam Timer**:
   - A dynamic progress bar serves as a countdown timer (1 minute per exam).
   - The timer adds urgency to the quiz experience.

6. **Question Navigation**:
   - Displays one question at a time.
   - A **Next** button navigates to the next question (no "Previous" button).
   - Next button is deactivated until the user selects an answer.

7. **Answer Selection**:
   - Users can select only one answer.
   - The selected answer is highlighted with a gray background.

8. **Randomization**:
   - Questions are randomized each time the exam starts.
   - Answers within each question are also randomized.

9. **Result Display**:
   - Displays results after all questions are answered or when the timer runs out.
   - Includes total questions, correct answers, and detailed feedback.
